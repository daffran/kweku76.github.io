This three-part graphic novel series is written by Nickelodeon TV series co-creator and executive producer Michael Dante DiMartino, drawn by Irene Koh, with covers by Koh and Heather Campbell, and consultation by TV series co-creator and executive producer Bryan Konietzko.

Turf Wars begins with Korra and Asami leaving the spirit world and returning to Republic City only to find political hijinks and human vs. spirit conflict, as a pompous developer plans to turn the new spirit portal into an amusement park, potentially severing an already tumultuous connection with the spirits. In order to get through it all, Korra and Asami vow to look out for each other—but first, they’ve got to get better at being a team. 
The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars Parts 1–3 serve as the official continuation of The Legend of Korra television series, and all volumes are available now through comic shops and book retailers.
